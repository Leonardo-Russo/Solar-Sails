## Abstract

This research scrutinizes the potential of solar sails in propelling interplanetary trajectories. By leveraging momentum from solar photons, the study emphasizes an optimal Earth-to-Venus trajectory within a two-dimensional heliocentric polar coordinate system.

## Introduction to Optimized Trajectories

This section delves into the exploration of efficient interplanetary trajectories by focusing on solar sails as a sustainable propulsion system. The detailed dynamical modeling is complemented by the associated MATLAB code, targeting the best route from Earth to Venus.

## Continuous Control Model

The continuous control model employs a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Gradient Method Optimization to determine the optimal trajectory for a low-thrust propulsion system. The section covers:
- Cost Function
- Optimality Conditions
- Particle Swarm Optimization
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Results

## Three-Arc Control Model

Here, the focus is on a three-arc trajectory optimization without the Lagrangian method. The main topics discussed include the integration of motion equations and the use of a hybrid method combining PSO and Gradient Descent. The results of this optimization strategy are also presented.

## Final Remarks

The project culminates in reflections on the challenges faced due to the constraints of adjusting the sail's orientation. It discusses the implications of the optimization algorithm's suggestions and the significance of approaching Venus with velocities similar to the planet's own.
